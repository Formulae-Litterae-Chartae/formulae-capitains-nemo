00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
On the Werkstatt's reading page,

00:02.800 --> 00:06.000
you can of course read a text from top to bottom. 

00:06.000 --> 00:08.500
But there is more information here

00:09.000 --> 00:10.500
for those who are interested. 

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
For instance, if you wish to read one of the footnotes,

00:15.200 --> 00:18.500
you can click on the superscript number or letter,

00:18.700 --> 00:21.000
in this case "g",

00:21.500 --> 00:26.000
and that footnote will highlighted here in the margin.

00:26.500 --> 00:31.000
You may also see words that are underlined with a wavy line. 

00:31.500 --> 00:34.000
These represent words

00:34.200 --> 00:37.500
for which we have an E-Lexicon article.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.500
If you click on one of the words,

00:39.800 --> 00:42.500
for instance "regnum",

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
the E-Lexicon article for that word will open in a pop-out window, 

00:47.200 --> 00:49.000
allowing you to read it

00:49.200 --> 00:52.800
without leaving the page with the original text. 

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
In this text, you may see other words

00:55.200 --> 00:58.500
that are underlined in the same way.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.000
If you click on one of these words,

01:01.500 --> 01:04.000
for instance "populus",

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
the current E-Lexicon article will close

01:07.000 --> 01:10.800
and a new one will open in the same window.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.500
If you wish to read the article along with the original text,

01:15.700 --> 01:20.500
you can click on "Read this entry in the parallel view"

01:20.800 --> 01:25.000
to see both texts side-by-side.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
You can then close one of these texts

01:29.200 --> 01:31.000
by clicking on the X symbol

01:31.200 --> 01:36.000
in the upper right-hand corner of that text.
