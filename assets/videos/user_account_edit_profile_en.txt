If you are logged in to your user account, you can manage your user settings by hovering over your username in the navbar and clicking on the "Edit Profile" link. Here you can change your password, your default language or your email address. Changes to your password or default language will take effect immediately whereas a change to your email address will need to be verified using a verification link sent to the new email address.
