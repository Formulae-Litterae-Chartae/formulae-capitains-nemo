00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
You can create your own user account in the Werkstatt

00:03.200 --> 00:05.400
that will allow you to save search results

00:05.600 --> 00:07.800
or text views to use again later

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
or to set the default language for the user interface.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.800
Both of these functions are covered in their own videos.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.800
To set up your user account

00:18.000 --> 00:21.500
click on the "Sign In" link in the navbar.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.000
Then, click on the "Click to Register" link

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
at the bottom of this page next to "New User?"

00:29.200 --> 00:32.000
On the user registration page

00:32.200 --> 00:35.000
first input your username

00:35.200 --> 00:38.400
and your email

00:38.600 --> 00:40.500
then a password

00:40.700 --> 00:43.500
and then repeat this password

00:43.800 --> 00:46.000
then choose your default language

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
and click on "Register".

00:49.000 --> 00:53.400
Note that the username and the email address

00:53.600 --> 00:55.500
must be unique.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.000
If another user is using one of these,

00:58.200 --> 00:59.800
then you will get a message

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
asking you to use a different user name

01:02.200 --> 01:05.000
or a different email address.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.000
Once you have registered your account

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
you should be able to click on the "Sign In" link

01:10.000 --> 01:12.500
in the navbar,

01:12.800 --> 01:14.500
and here input your username

01:14.500 --> 01:16.000
and your new password

01:16.200 --> 01:20.000
then click on "Sign In" to access your account.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.200
