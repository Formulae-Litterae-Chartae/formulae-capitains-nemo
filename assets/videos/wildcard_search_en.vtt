00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
It is possible to use either the asterisk

00:03.400 --> 00:07.400
or the question mark character in the search query

00:07.600 --> 00:10.800
as a wildcard within a search term.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
The question mark represents a single letter

00:14.000 --> 00:17.800
whereas the asterisk represents one or more letters.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.800
Neither one can replace a blank space,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.500
which means that they only function within a single word.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.000
So, if I wanted to search for every word

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
that begins with the letters "r-e-g-n",

00:34.200 --> 00:40.000
I should input "regn*".

00:40.500 --> 00:44.000
This will return hits on words such as

00:44.000 --> 00:50.200
"regnum", "regnante" or "regno".

00:50.400 --> 00:57.500
If we change this query to "regn?",

00:57.700 --> 01:02.500
it will return all words that start with "r-e-g-n"

01:02.700 --> 01:04.300
followed by a single letter,

01:04.400 --> 01:08.500
for instance, "regno" or "regni",

01:08.600 --> 01:10.800
but not "regnum"

01:10.800 --> 01:16.000
since there are two letters after "r-e-g-n" in "regnum".

01:16.200 --> 01:20.000
The wildcard search works both in the advanced

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
and the simple search.
