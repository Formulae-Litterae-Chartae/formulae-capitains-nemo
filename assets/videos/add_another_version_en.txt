You can add another version of the same text, that is a translation, transcription or manuscript image, by clicking on, for instance, "Translation" to open the German translation of a formula next to the Latin text.
If you click on "Transcriptions" or "Manuscript Images", you can choose the manuscript from which to see the transcription or image.
And, as always, to close one of these texts, simply click on the X symbol in the upper right-hand corner.
