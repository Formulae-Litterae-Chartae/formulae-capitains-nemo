Sometimes it can be useful to search the short summaries of the formulae and the charters, the regesta, instead of the text of the documents themselves. The simple search does this automatically, searching for the query in both the texts and the regesta. So, for instance, searching for the word "Schenkung" will return every document where the word "Schenkung" appears in the text or the regest of the document. Since "Schenkung" is not a latin word, the results all come from the regesta.
If, on the other hand, you want to search the regesta using the advanced search, you should select the "Regest" option from under the text input field and then type in your query, for instance "Schenkung", and we see that the results are the same as with the simple search.
