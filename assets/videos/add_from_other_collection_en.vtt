00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
You can add a text from another collection

00:03.200 --> 00:06.000
by clicking on "More texts"

00:6.200 --> 00:10.000
and following the trail to the text that you want.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
In this case, we want to open the formula Tours 44

00:15.200 --> 00:19.000
next to Marculf II,35.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.500
So we click on "Formulae",

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
then on "Formelsammlung aus Tours",

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
then on "[Edition]" next to Tours 44.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.500
Now we can compare the texts 

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
of Marculf II,35 and Tours 44.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.000
And, as always, to close one of these texts,

00:52.500 --> 00:57.000
simply click on the X symbol in the upper right-hand corner.
