00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Sometimes it can be useful to search

00:02.200 --> 00:05.000
the short summaries of the formulae and the charters,

00:05.000 --> 00:06.500
the regesta,

00:06.500 --> 00:10.000
instead of the text of the documents themselves.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.500
The simple search does this automatically,

00:12.700 --> 00:15.000
searching for the query in both the texts

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
and the regesta.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
So, for instance, searching for the word "Schenkung"

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
will return every document

00:26.000 --> 00:27.200
where the word "Schenkung" appears

00:27.200 --> 00:31.500
in the text or the regest of the document.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.000
Since "Schenkung" is not a latin word,

00:34.200 --> 00:38.000
the results all come from the regesta.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.000
If, on the other hand,

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
you want to search the regesta

00:41.200 --> 00:44.400
using the advanced search,

00:44.500 --> 00:47.400
you should select the "Regest" option

00:47.500 --> 00:50.000
from under the text input field

00:50.200 --> 00:54.000
and then type in your query,

00:54.200 --> 00:57.000
for instance "Schenkung",

00:57.500 --> 00:59.000
and we see that the results

00:59.200 --> 01:03.000
are the same as with the simple search.
