00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
In addition to searching to searching inflected forms,

00:03.200 --> 00:06.000
you can also search lemmatized forms,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
that is the dictionary forms, of words

00:08.000 --> 00:11.500
in select corpora in the Werkstatt.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.500
You can do a lemma search using the simple search

00:14.500 --> 00:16.800
by checking the box next to "Lemma"

00:17.000 --> 00:19.500
and then typing in your search query,

00:19.800 --> 00:24.000
for instance, "regnum" and hitting Enter.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.500
In the results that follow

00:27.500 --> 00:30.000
you will see both the word "regnum"

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
as well as other forms of this lemma,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.500
for instance "regno" and "regni".

00:37.500 --> 00:39.500
You can also perform a lemma search

00:39.600 --> 00:42.000
using the advanced search page.

00:42.200 --> 00:47.000
In the middle column simply click on "Lemmata",

00:47.000 --> 00:49.500
and then type in your search query.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.800
Then hit Enter or click the "Search" button,

00:53.800 --> 00:56.500
and here we see the same results

00:56.500 --> 00:59.000
as with the simple lemma search.
