You can add another version of the same text,

00:04.500 --> 00:10.300
that is a translation, transcription or manuscript image,

00:10.500 --> 00:15.000
by clicking on, for instance, "Translation"

00:15.200 --> 00:19.000
to open the German translation of a formula

00:19.200 --> 00:22.000
next to the Latin text.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
If you click on "Transcriptions"

00:26.200 --> 00:28.500
or "Manuscript Images",

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
you can choose the manuscript from which to see the transcription or image.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
And, as always, to close one of these texts,

00:43.200 --> 00:47.000
simply click on the X symbol in the upper right-hand corner.
