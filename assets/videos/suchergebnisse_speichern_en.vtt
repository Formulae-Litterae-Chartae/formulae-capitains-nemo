00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
You can save search results as well as other Werkstatt pages

00:04.500 --> 00:06.000
in your account

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
so that you can call them back up later.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
To do this you must be logged in.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
In this case we have searched for "regnum".

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Here we see the search results.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
We want to look more closely at the results for Marculf I,1.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Here we see the formula Marculf I,1,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
the search result "regnum"

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
and we want to save it for later.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
So we go to our account

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
and click on "Save this page".

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
We can give this page a name, Marculf I,1.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
We should save the search results as well.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Then click "Save Page".

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
The page is now saved

00:53.000 --> 00:56.500
and can be called up again using your account.

00:56.500 --> 01:01.000
To do this go to your account,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
"Saved Pages".

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Here you see all of the pages that you have saved.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
You can delete a page

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
by clicking on "Remove from the list".

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
To call a page up again

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
simply click on the page name.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
And the search results are brought up again

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
along with the yellow highlighting.
