You can save search results as well as other Werkstatt pages

00:04.500 --> 00:06.000
in your account

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
so that you can call them back up later.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
To do this you must be logged in.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.500
In this case we have searched for "regnum".

00:15.800 --> 00:19.000
Here we see the search results.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.000
We would like to look more closely at the search results for Marculf I,1.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.000

00:33.200 --> 00:36.500
We want to save this page for later.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.000
So we go to our account

00:40.100 --> 00:43.000
and click on "Save this page".

00:43.500 --> 00:50.000
We can give this page a name, for instance Marculf I,1.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.000
And we want to be sure to save the search results.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.000
Then we click on "Save Page".

00:59.500 --> 01:01.000
The page is now saved

01:01.200 --> 01:05.000
and can be called up again using your account.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.000
To do this go to your account,

01:09.200 --> 01:12.000
and click on "Saved Pages".

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Here you see all the pages that you have saved.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.000
You can delete a page by clicking on "Remove from the list".

01:22.500 --> 01:24.000
To call a page up again
