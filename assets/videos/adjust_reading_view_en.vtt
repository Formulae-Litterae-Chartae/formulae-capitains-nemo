00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
You can do several things to change the how the reading view looks.

00:05.500 --> 00:10.000
You can make the footnote columns in the margins smaller

00:10.500 --> 00:12.800
or larger,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
depending on whether you want to focus on the text

00:16.500 --> 00:20.000
or the footnotes.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.800
Or if you would prefer to read the texts one on top of the other

00:25.000 --> 00:27.500
instead of side-by-side,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
you can click on the row icon above the texts.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.500
Then, you can click this icon to expand all texts

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
to show the whole text

00:40.500 --> 00:42.000
and this icon

00:42.500 --> 00:46.000
to bring all text windows back to their original size,

00:46.500 --> 00:50.000
where you may have to scroll to read the whole text.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
You can then click on the column symbol

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
to return to the side-by-side view.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.000
And, as always, to close one of these texts,

01:04.200 --> 01:10.000
simply click on the X symbol in the upper right-hand corner.
